# Roadmap
- [ ] Draft a proposal
- [ ] Get feeback, compile a list of current neuroscientists who are julia users.
- [ ] Build the wesite (have a "card" like format for all current users to show their top neuro packages)?
- [ ] Add org to julia lists.

# Proposal
**Building a community of both julia users & developers around the field of neuroscience.**
Most of themaths and analytical techniques that are used in neuroscience are covered under other Julia umbrellas (e.g. Digital Signal Processing, Image Analysis, ML etc.). Thus the aim of this group would be to serve as a hub to show/and develop these in neuro-specific use cases. This might be especially important for attracting new neuroscientists to Julia who might otherwise consider themselves uncatered for. 

**Julia Neuro Could (potentially) Provide:**
  - A channel/tag on the julia discourse group for neuroscience related questions
    -or a gitter/slack channel for collaboration on package-development
  - Build a bank of tutorials (notebooks) that use julia for neuroscience (these can either be new or translations of old tutorials written in other languages)
Exposure
  - A github organisation to host repositories that facilitate any neuroscience related analyses.
  - A website providing exposure for neuroscience-related packages packages + links to funding, meetups etc.
  - Building up a list (& a highlights roll) of use-cases for julia in neuroscience. i.e. papers & analyses that have been developed in the language, along with stories of how the specifics of julia-lang helped/hindered along the way.
Funding?
   - Obtain and distribute funding for the development & maintenance of neuroscience packages written in Julia
   - Ditto for meetups


Positive or negative comments? Get in touch great to hear from a range of both current julia users / developers as well as neuroscientists who may not have even heard of julia yet! Either submit an issue here, a PR, or get in touch with me directly.
